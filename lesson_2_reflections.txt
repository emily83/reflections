What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

the directory becomes a git repository under version control.
a .git hidden directory is created with meta data about commits
this is needed so git knows the directory is a repository and has somewhere
to save commit history


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a temporary location for files to be put before committing.
It allows you to queue up files for a commit as and when you are done with them
then review before finalising the commit
